					<h3>Who is me?</h3>
						<p>Born in Stamford Connecticut, I moved across the pond to London when I was at the tender age of 2. After 8 years as a die-hard Gunner, we relocated back across the atlantic to Tribeca, New York. Four Years Ago, after many misdiagnoses following a spell of mono and pneumonia, I was diagnosed with POTS, an autonomic heart condition that slows down my heart rate. My symptoms include chronic pain, exhaustion, headaches, chronic fatigue and IBS. It has taken me some time, but four years later, I am the best I have ever been. I play soccer, train Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, bike, lift, and do yoga. On top of this, I'm gluten free, dairy free, and red-meat free.</p>

					<h3>My Little Brother</h3>
					<p>What Sebastian lacks in wits he makes up for in height. He stands a whopping 6'4", but he's truly a gentle giant. Why, he would'nt even harm a fly. His height is actually quite annoying. He's taller than me, but not tall enough to make it in any sort of basketball playing career.</p>

					<h3>My Little Sister</h3>
					<p>My adopted sister Lula. She's half pit half something. We're not sure. We rescued her. She, like Sebastian, lacks some serious smarts. Seriously, she runs sidewise, hates eye contact, and is just weird. But she's extremely cute and tough looking at the same time.</p>
